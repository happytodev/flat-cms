Hello all, whith this new version, I win 2 more functionalities.

## Pagination

It seems obvious, but until now, I didn't have pagination on page list. Now, I have !

## Update script

Especially, in this development phase, I know that launching a lot of command after update me is boring. So after some talks with my dad, we decided to add me a new artisan command.

Let me introduce you **typhoon:update** :


```bash
php artisan typhoon:update
```

As you can see, I ask you from which version you came, and my update script do the needed job.

I hope this version give you satisfaction.

Ah and don't forget that you can come on my [github discussion page](https://github.com/happytodev/typhoon/discussions) and submit you idea to improve me or vote for the best idea already submitted.

See you for my next version !
