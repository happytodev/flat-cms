Hello, Im' glad you want using me in your project.

Bellow I give you the steps to follow to install me.

Are you ready, let's go !

## Step 1 - Install a fresh Laravel application

For that, you can 

```bash
laravel new your-awesome-project-name
```

or

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel your-awesome-project-name
```

Enter in your project : 


```bash
cd your-awesome-project-name
```

## Step 2 - Install TyphoonCms via composer

```bash
composer require happytodev/typhoon
```


As Typhoon, use `filament-navigation` plugin from Ryan Chandler and as I adapted it (fork is here https://github.com/happytodev/filament-navigation) to be compliant with Orbit (also from Ryan) and as the PR is waiting approval from Ryan, you have to set an another settings before install Typhoon.

Follow these steps :

```json
    "repositories": [
        {
          "type": "vcs",
          "url": "https://github.com/happytodev/filament-navigation"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
      "ryangjchandler/filament-navigation": "dev-main"
    }
```

Save the `composer.json` file and run `composer update`

Alternatively, if you don't add above require block in your `composer.json` file, you can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require ryangjchandler/filament-navigation=dev-main
```

To use Orbit with filament-navigation, you have to add a key to your .env file :

```env
  FILAMENT_NAVIGATION_DB_ENGINE=orbit
```

As you edit the `.env` file, give a name to your website by adding the following key to your .env file

```env
TYPHOONCMS_NAME="MyWebsite"
```

Always in your `.env` file replace following : 

```env

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=
DB_USERNAME=
DB_PASSWORD=
```

by : 

```env
DB_CONNECTION=orbit
```

## Step 3 - Use the typhoon:install command

TyphoonCms comes with a command which help to install the Cms.

You just have to launch it :

```bash
php artisan typhoon:install
```

When the script ask you `User model file already exists. Do you want to overwrite it? (yes/no) [no]:` you can answer yes. It will modify the default User model to adapt it to use Orbit instead classic database like for example MySQL.

## Step 4 - Give your user the admin rights

Last thing, go to the `content\users`folders and edit with your favorite editor the first user, usually it is the file `1.md`:

```md

name: 'John Doe'
email: john@doe.com

```

modify this line `is_admin: 0` to this one `is_admin: true` :

```md
---
id: 1
name: 'John Doe'
email: john@doe.com
password: $2y$10$0wdxKSl7ksxk8yrTgU8!K90oLmMq2eJ20pwUBSu0ICMWpc959DpTqm
is_admin: true
